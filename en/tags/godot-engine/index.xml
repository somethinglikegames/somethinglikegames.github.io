The difference between Godot 3.x and Godot 4 is huge. While there are already various tutorials on many of the changes, it seems to me that the area of network programming has been neglected and that although, or maybe because, there have been a lot of changes there as well. In addition, I&amp;rsquo;m particularly interested in this part, because so far almost only pure multiplayer games have managed to fascinate me for a long time and I can use my professional experience in this area.</description></item><item><title>Is Godot 4 ready for AA- or even AAA?</title><link>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/status-of-godot-4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2023 11:30:15 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/status-of-godot-4/</guid><description>Shortly after I posted my last article, Juan Linietsky, one of the founders of Godot Engine, published an article about the competitiveness of Godot Engine in AA and AAA game development.

While in the early days of video game development, the sound and graphics output used for almost every game was developed or reworked in-house, nowadays you can choose from a variety of possible tools.
I have &amp;ldquo;published&amp;rdquo; two computer games so far.
The first game was a 2D jump&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;run that told the story of my (now) wife and me, which we used as wedding invitations.</description></item></channel></rss>
