I had written then about the supported DTLS version: &amp;ldquo;I couldn’t find out yet which version is used by Godot, but as soon as I know, I will tell you.&amp;rdquo; And now is the time to share this information with you.</description></item><item><title>Scene Replication with Godot 4(.1)</title><link>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/scene-replication/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jul 2023 18:40:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/scene-replication/</guid><description>For this article I would like to apologize in advance that the positions of text and images are not always quite coherent. Unfortunately I couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of a better positioning, but I hope you can cope with it. After the tutorial series, which offers a good basic framework, today&amp;rsquo;s tutorial is about a topic that you can really see. The example shown here is based on a blog post by Fabio Alessandrelli, one of the main developers for the Godot network functionality. And since I don&amp;rsquo;t want to just copy everything, here&amp;rsquo;s how you can also use the techniques shown there when using path-dependent multiplayer APIs.</description></item><item><title>A small interim report</title><link>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/a-small-interim-report/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2023 11:45:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/a-small-interim-report/</guid><description>My last article is unfortunately already over four weeks ago. Actually, two new articles should have been published again, but what can I say? :thinking_face: I just didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to write more articles in the last weeks :person_shrugging:. In general I haven&amp;rsquo;t been very busy with the Godot Engine in the last weeks, but I hope that it will be more now.</description></item><item><title>Networking tutorial 6: Encrypted connections using DTLS</title><link>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/network-tutorial-6-dtls/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2023 11:45:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/network-tutorial-6-dtls/</guid><description>In the last article we completed the login process. However, before using it in real life, we should first secure our network connections. The least one should do and, if I understand the GDPR correctly, must do, is to transmit user passwords only using encrypted channels on the Internet. Ideally, one extends encrypted communication to the entire infrastructure. So that&amp;rsquo;s what this article is going to be about: We encrypt the network connections between our servers and clients.</description></item><item><title>Networking tutorial 5: Login 3 - world server</title><link>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/network-tutorial-5-login-3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Mar 2023 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/network-tutorial-5-login-3/</guid><description>In the last article we finished implementing the gateway and authentication server, so that the game client is issued a token for valid credentials. This token should now be used to log in to the world server. Therefore, in this article, we will extend the game client so that it forwards the token to the world server, and then enable the world server to verify the token.</description></item><item><title>Networking tutorial 4: Login 2 - gateway and authentication server</title><link>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/network-tutorial-4-login-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2023 11:30:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/network-tutorial-4-login-2/</guid><description>The source code for this tutorial series can be found in this GitHub repository.

This article deals with the first part of our login process and we create the game client to the point where it connects to the gateway server and sends the login data there. But before that we will discuss a bit more generally the login process and RPCs in Godot.</description></item><item><title>Networking tutorial 2: The "walking skeleton"</title><link>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/network-tutorial-2-walking-skeleton/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Feb 2023 11:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/network-tutorial-2-walking-skeleton/</guid><description>Ich habe wirklich lange über die &lt;em>richtige&lt;/em> Vorgehensweise für dieses Tutorial nachgedacht. Schließlich gibt es verschiedene Möglichkeiten, wenn man, wie hier, die aktuell geplanten vier Komponenten entwickeln möchte. Ein Extremfall wäre es, pro Tutorial jeweils eine Komponente vollständig zu entwickeln und dadurch erst zum Schluss die Kommunikation zwischen den Komponenten zu ermöglichen. Ich habe mich für eine andere Variante entschieden und setze alle Komponenten direkt ohne wirkliche Funktionalität auf, um sie anschließend in jedem Tutorial, passend zum Thema, mit weiteren Inhalten zu füllen.</description></item><item><title>Networking tutorial 1: General information and overview</title><link>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/network-tutorial-1-overview/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/network-tutorial-1-overview/</guid><description>Godot 4 is on its way to the first release candidate. The difference between Godot 3.x and Godot 4 is huge. While there are already various tutorials on many of the changes, it seems to me that the area of network programming has been neglected and that although, or maybe because, there have been a lot of changes there as well. In addition, I&amp;rsquo;m particularly interested in this part, because so far almost only pure multiplayer games have managed to fascinate me for a long time and I can use my professional experience in this area.</description></item><item><title>Is Godot 4 ready for AA- or even AAA?</title><link>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/status-of-godot-4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2023 11:30:15 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/status-of-godot-4/</guid><description>Shortly after I posted my last article, Juan Linietsky, one of the founders of Godot Engine, published an article about the competitiveness of Godot Engine in AA and AAA game development.
The article is really worth reading, because on the one hand he goes into the technical possibilities with Godot 4 (renderer, physics, scripting, GDExtension, &amp;hellip;) and on the other hand he points out what he thinks is still missing to develop AA/AAA level games with the Godot Engine.</description></item><item><title>Why I chose Godot Engine</title><link>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/why-i-chose-godot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 18:56:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/why-i-chose-godot/</guid><description>If you want to deal with game development in this day and age, you are confronted with a luxury problem right from the start. While in the early days of video game development, the sound and graphics output used for almost every game was developed or reworked in-house, nowadays you can choose from a variety of possible tools.
I have &amp;ldquo;published&amp;rdquo; two computer games so far.
The first game was a 2D jump&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;run that told the story of my (now) wife and me, which we used as wedding invitations.</description></item><item><title>The reason for this blog</title><link>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/why-this-blog/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 18:56:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/why-this-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome to our site!&lt;/p>&lt;p>Nice that you take the trouble to read this text.
