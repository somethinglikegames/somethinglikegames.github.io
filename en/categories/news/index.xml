The article is really worth reading, because on the one hand he goes into the technical possibilities with Godot 4 (renderer, physics, scripting, GDExtension, &amp;hellip;) and on the other hand he points out what he thinks is still missing to develop AA/AAA level games with the Godot Engine.</description></item></channel></rss>
