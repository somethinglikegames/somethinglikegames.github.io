I had written then about the supported DTLS version: &amp;ldquo;I couldnâ€™t find out yet which version is used by Godot, but as soon as I know, I will tell you.&amp;rdquo; And now is the time to share this information with you.</description></item><item><title>Is Godot 4 ready for AA- or even AAA?</title><link>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/status-of-godot-4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2023 11:30:15 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.somethinglikegames.de/en/blog/2023/status-of-godot-4/</guid><description>Shortly after I posted my last article, Juan Linietsky, one of the founders of Godot Engine, published an article about the competitiveness of Godot Engine in AA and AAA game development.
The article is really worth reading, because on the one hand he goes into the technical possibilities with Godot 4 (renderer, physics, scripting, GDExtension, &amp;hellip;) and on the other hand he points out what he thinks is still missing to develop AA/AAA level games with the Godot Engine.</description></item></channel></rss>
